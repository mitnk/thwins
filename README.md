Thwins - Keep Vim Displaying Three Windows
=======================================

Windows are always organised as follows:

    ===================================
    |              |        S1        |
    |     Main     |===================
    |              |        S2        |
    ===================================

Priority Rules for Buffers
--------------------------

`Current` > `Main` > `Displayed` > `New opened` > `Others`

Install
-------

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin/ && \
    curl -o ~/.vim/plugin/thwins.vim \
